## Detection Logic

The command scans:

**For Skills**:
```bash
# Check generated-skills/ directory
ls generated-skills/*/SKILL.md

# Check if installed
ls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

**For Agents**:
```bash
# Check project-level
ls .claude/agents/*.md

# Check user-level
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md
```

**For Prompts**:
- Analyzes recent conversation
- Looks for generated prompts (XML, the AI, the AI assistant, Gemini formats)
- Checks token count announcements

**For Hooks**:
```bash
# Check generated-hooks/ directory
ls generated-hooks/*/hook.json

# Check if installed (user-level)
grep -r "hook.json" ~/.claude/settings.json

# Check if installed (project-level)
grep -r "hook.json" .claude/settings.json
```
