description: Initialize or enhance the AI.md files using the the AI-md-enhancer skill with interactive workflow and 100% native format compliance
---

# the AI.md Enhancer Command

This command uses the `the AI-md-enhancer` skill to initialize or enhance the AI.md files for your project.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery - Check Current State

### Check if the AI.md exists

!`ls -la the AI.md 2>/dev/null || echo "the AI.md not found"`

### Check for modular the AI.md files

!`find . -name "the AI.md" -type f -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.git/*" | head -10`

### Get repository status

!`git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repository"`

### Check project structure

!`ls -la`

---

## Phase 2: Analysis - Determine Action

Based on the discovery above, I need to determine the appropriate action:

**If the AI.md does NOT exist** → Interactive Initialization Workflow
**If the AI.md exists** → Analysis and Enhancement Workflow

### For New Projects (No the AI.md):

The `the AI-md-enhancer` skill will:
1. Explore your repository structure
2. Detect project type, tech stack, team size, development phase
3. Show you the discoveries and ask for confirmation
4. Create customized the AI.md file(s) after your approval
5. Apply 100% native format compliance (project structure diagrams, setup instructions, architecture sections)

### For Existing Projects (the AI.md exists):

The `the AI-md-enhancer` skill will:
1. Analyze current the AI.md for quality and completeness
2. Calculate quality score (0-100)
3. Identify missing sections
4. Provide actionable recommendations
5. Offer to enhance with missing native format sections

---

## Phase 3: Task - Execute with Skill or Agent

### Option A: Direct Skill Invocation

I can invoke the `the AI-md-enhancer` skill directly to handle the appropriate workflow based on what I discovered above.

The skill provides:
- ✨ **100% Native Format Compliance**: All generated files follow official the AI coding agent format with project structure diagrams, setup instructions, architecture sections, and file structure explanations
- 🆕 **Interactive Initialization**: For new projects, explores repository and asks for confirmation before creating files
- ✅ **Intelligent Analysis**: For existing projects, scans and evaluates for quality and completeness
- 🚀 **Smart Generation**: Creates customized the AI.md files from scratch
- 🔧 **Enhancement**: Adds missing sections and improves existing files
- 📦 **Modular Architecture**: Supports context-specific files (backend/, frontend/, database/)

### Option B: Agent Invocation (Recommended for Maintenance)

For ongoing maintenance and automatic updates throughout your project lifecycle, I can invoke the `the AI-md-guardian` agent instead:

**When to use the agent**:
- After feature completion
- After major refactoring
- When new dependencies are added
- After architecture changes
- For periodic the AI.md synchronization

**Agent benefits**:
- 🔄 **Auto-Sync**: Updates the AI.md based on detected changes
- 🎯 **Smart Detection**: Only updates when significant changes occur
- ⚡ **Token-Efficient**: Uses the AI model model for routine updates
- 📦 **Milestone-Aware**: Triggers after completion signals
- ✨ **Native Format**: Ensures 100% the AI coding agent format compliance

### Your Task

I'm ready to proceed. What would you like me to do?

**For new projects**: I'll run the interactive initialization workflow (skill)
**For existing projects**: I'll analyze your current the AI.md and suggest improvements (skill)
**For maintenance**: I'll invoke the AI-md-guardian agent to check for updates and synchronize

Please confirm how you'd like to proceed, or let me know if you have specific requirements (e.g., "Create a the AI.md for my Python FastAPI project" or "Invoke the AI-md-guardian to update my the AI.md").
